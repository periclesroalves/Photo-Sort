To build:
---------
    - You should have the OpenCV library installed.
    - You should have CMake installed.
    - use "cmake ." if new source files were created.
    - use "make" to perform a simple build.

To run:
-------
    - Use "./sort <img1-path> <img2-path> ... <imgN-path>".
    - This will create a txt file called "order.txt", with one picture path per line, sorted by
      similarity.
