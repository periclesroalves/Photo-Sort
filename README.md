Photo sort for Facebook

After uploading their photos to Facebook, users usually have to manually sort the resulting albums in order to provide a pleasant experience to the viewer. This process, in general, takes some time and effort. In that sense, Photo Sort allows Facebook users to automatically sort their photo albums, either be color similarity or feature (objects) detection. To accomplish this, the app uses the OpenCV computer vision library, designed for real time computing. When it comes to performance, though object detection tends to deliver better results, it takes some time to compute. In the other hand, color comparison gives less accurate results, but in a fraction of the time taken by object detection.
